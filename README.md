# STL-Mesh-FEA
The project aims to convert a given .stl file to voxelised numpy ndarray and hence to generate an Abaqus input file based on the ndarray.

The stl-mesh conversion is done through stl2vox_cpp.py

NOTE:
To run the stl2vox_cpp.py, VOXSURF needs to be installed. The installation instuction is inside the .py file.
